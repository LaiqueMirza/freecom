      <div>
        <p>
          We believe that the right kind of basics are the most fundamental part
          of an outfit. They are wardrobe essentials for any man because it's
          the basics that act as the building blocks of an outfit while the
          statement pieces add surprise and take the look to the next level. We
          have put together a list of products that don't only add to your
          statement looks but could also come in handy on days that you want to
          keep it effortless and simple.

          1. White Shirt
        </div>
        <p>
          The first thing that comes to our mind while we think of basics is a
          classic full sleeve white shirt. Be it to be worn with a suit or
          casually with a pair of loose-fit ripped jeans, a white is one of the
          most important wardrobe essentials for a man.

        <p>
          Solid T-shirts are a must-have especially if you like to keep your
          fits effortless and young. Whether under a blazer or a statement
          shacket, a solid T-shirt simply completes your look. Our tip will be
          to experiment with colors in this department, instead of sticking to
          the classics.

        <p>
          How could there ever be a list of men’s wardrobe essentials without
          jeans included in it? We leave the fit up to you and your liking, but
          a pair of high-quality classic blue jeans without any wash is
          something one should really invest in. And it gets even better if you
          could get one tailored.

        <p>
          Be it a dinner date or a semi-formal work event, a black blazer is the
          safest bet to looking smart. A blazer is so versatile, you could go
          for an oversized one and style it with streetwear to make it quite
          modern and chic.

          If sneakers aren’t your thing and you find oxfords boring, we
          recommend you try a pair of Chelsea boots. Even though it is something
          classic, it is highly in trend right now and there are various styles
          available across budgets.

        <p>
          It goes without saying that sunglasses are equally functional and a
          style statement if chosen wisely. Go for classic styles like aviators
          or wayfarers to keep it simple. But investing in a unique frame is
          highly recommended as it could become a part of your personality.

          For the ones who prefer classics over trending styles, a polo t-shirt
          is the best summer staple. While there a wide range of colors
          available today, you can dress it up by adding a nice single piece of
          jewelry or watch too.
